            Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. 
            Add beef and stir-fry until browned and no longer 
            pink in the centers, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and carrots; 
            stir-fry until onions start to turn golden, 7 to 8 minutes.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Pour in water and add potatoes; add more water if needed to cover. 
            Cover the pan with a lid and cook until potatoes are soft, 
            10 to 12 minutes. Add curry sauce mix and stir until mixture 
            thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.
