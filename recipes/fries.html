        <p>
            Learn how to make French fries that 
            are super crispy with this twice-fried 
            method. I don't think most people realize 
            that any decent French fry needs to be 
            fried twice. The first frying is done at a 
            lower temperature, which softens the potato 
            and prepares the starchy surface for the 
            second frying's crispification.
